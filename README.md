# Cryptocurrencies

## Background

Using MUnsupervised Machine Learning to pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to a firm.  Goal is to get an overall idea of how cryptocurrencies are performing by tracking trends. 
## Purpose

Data was transformed into data frames, table, visualizations to show what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this investment. The data was processed to fit unsupervised machine learning models. Categorizing cryptocurrencies was done through a clustering algorithm. Data visualizations were generated to pitch the investment.

This project entailed:

1.	Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2.	Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3.	Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4.	Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
